## Day 1 (OOPS Concept)

**OOP:** Object Oriented Programming is a way to write programs by using objects. Each object has data and actions. This helps to understand the program easier.

---

**Class:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It evolved from variables and structure (struct in C) by combining both data and functions into a single unit.

---

**Object:** An object is an instance created from a class. It holds actual values for the attributes in class and performs operations using the method defined in the class.

---

**Inheritance:** It allows a class to take behavior and property of another class. It helps us reuse code and create relationship between the classes.

---

**Encapsulation:** It means keeping data and methods together in a class and hiding details from the outside.

---

**Polymorphism:** In simple terms it means "one thing in many form". A single method or a function that works in different ways based on the object using it.

---

**Abstraction:** It means showing only important details to the user and hiding the complex inner workings.
