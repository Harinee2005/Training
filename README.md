## Day 1 (OOPS Concept)

**OOP:** Object Oriented Programming is a way to write programs by using objects in a organized way. Each object has data (attributes) and actions (methods). This approach helps us to understand and manage programs more easily.

---

**Class:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It evolved from variables and structure (like struct in C) by combining both data and functions into a single unit.

---

**Object:** An object is an instance created from a class. It holds actual values for the attributes in the class and performs operations using the methods defined in the class.

---

**Inheritance:** It allows a class to take behavior and properties of another class. It helps us to reuse code and create relationships between the classes.

---

**Encapsulation:** It means keeping data and methods together in a class and hiding details from the outside. This keeps the data safe by controlling how other parts of the program can see or change it. It uses methods called getters (to read data) and setters (to update data).

---

**Polymorphism:** In simple terms, it means "one thing in many forms". A single method or a function that works in different ways based on the object using it. 
- Overloading: Using the same method name with different inputs. 
- Overriding: Changing a method from the parent class in a child class to do something new.

---

**Abstraction:** It means showing only important details to the user and hiding the complex inner workings.
